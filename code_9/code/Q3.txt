Using thread can improve the execution performance than squencial programming.
One more thing that is good about thread is that the code will not be as hard as asynchoronous programming.
For example, we want to add the result from disk read to sum after we get the return.
In aRead.c, this will be done in handle_read, but it is arranged before disk read in the code, so it makes programmer harder to follow.
However, in tRead.c, this will be done in read_block, which has the usual order of disk read and addition.
